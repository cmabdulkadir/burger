# Burger

## Description

In this assignment, you'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

## Installation

First run npm i in order to install the dependencies. The application itself can be invoked with node server.js in the intergreated termeinal.

You must also have MySQL Workbench to run the schema.sql. 

## Usage

Run server.js in the intergrated terminal, it'll log you with a local host. You can also see the deplopyed version via [Heroku](https://burger20211.herokuapp.com/)
